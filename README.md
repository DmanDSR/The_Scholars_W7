### By: Gian Villafane, Taisgaly Velez, Ricardo A. Torres, Dylan Sedeno

# Description

 Machine Learning project!

 [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/XPwTEmD7/ATTI9e7faf9f69c0139fca2cc4e9919246064C983571/the-scholars-week-7)

# Project Overview

- Our main objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the likelihood of students dropping out based on various indicators found within our dataset. 

- These indicators include academic performance, attendance records, and socio-economic factors, among others.

- Implementing this model could significantly enhance educational institutions' ability to intervene proactively, offering targeted support to students who are most at risk.

# Data Selection and Preparation

### Selection

- The dataset contains comprehensive academic and demographic information about students, including their grades, attendance records, and socio-economic backgrounds.

- Data includes multiple academic years and is structured to highlight individual student trajectories, making it ideal for longitudinal analysis

### Preparation:

- Verification of Data Integrity: Checked for any missing values and inconsistencies; none were found.

- Feature Selection: Identified relevant features for predicting dropout rates based on educational insights and previous research.

- Our dataset required minimal preprocessing, allowing us to focus more on model selection and tuning to better predict student dropouts.
